| 4 | Learning System — "lecture recording" | ⚠ Partial | Recordings model + faculty upload endpoint exist, but no student-facing recording playback endpoint |

---

## 5. Bugs & Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Course `difficulty_level` missing "Master" level** | `courses/models.py:32` | SRS specifies 4 levels: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, **Master**. The column comment shows only 3. This is a data validation gap — "master" can be stored but isn't documented/enforced. |

### 🟡 Medium

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 2 | **No PUT/PATCH/DELETE endpoints exist** | All modules | Cannot update or delete any resource (courses, exams, users, etc.). Only create + read operations exist. |
| 3 | **No course payment/checkout flow** | `courses/routes.py` | Enrollment stores `price_paid` but there's no payment gateway integration or validation. Students can enroll without paying. |
| 4 | **`category_scores` are never populated** | `exams/services.py` | The `CategoryScore` table exists and analysis endpoint works, but no service ever inserts records into this table. Exam submission doesn't categorize scores. |
| 5 | **Monthly exam count not enforced as 3** | `exams/models.py` | SRS says "3 monthly exams". The `MonthlyExam` table has `month_number` but there's no validation enforcing exactly 3 per course. |
| 6 | **Pass/fail progression not enforced for course levels** | `courses/services.py` | SRS says pass/fail determines level progression. Enrollment doesn't check exam results before allowing access to next level. |

### 🟢 Low

| # | Issue | Location | Impact |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 7 | **Debug traceback exposed in faculty lecture creation** | `faculty/routes.py:52` | `traceback.format_exc()` is returned in the 500 response body. Security risk in production. |
| 8 | **`app.fix.py` committed to repo** | `app/fix.py` | Internal bcrypt fix script should not be in production code. |
| 9 | **No input validation on `difficulty_level`** | `courses/schemas.py` | Any string accepted — no enum constraint for beginner/intermediate/advanced/master. |
| 10 | **`docker/dump_logs.py` committed** | `docker/dump_logs.py` | Debug utility should not be in production. |

### Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Populate `category_scores`** during exam submission to make skill analysis functional end-to-end
2. **Add text-to-audio** endpoint (e.g., via OpenAI TTS or gTTS) for lesson content
3. **Add student recording playback** endpoint under `/lectures/{id}/recordings`
4. **Enforce course level progression** — check exam pass before next-level enrollment
5. **Add UPDATE/DELETE operations** for courses, exams, users (admin CRUD)
6. **Validate `difficulty_level`** via enum constraint (beginner, intermediate, advanced, master)
7. **Remove debug files** (`app/fix.py`, `docker/dump_logs.py`) from production
8. **Remove traceback exposure** in `faculty/routes.py`
